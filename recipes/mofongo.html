    <h2>What is Mofongo?</h2>
    <p>Plantain mofongo is thought to originate in Puerto Rico, and is a dish
       made from fried green (unripe) plantains mashed together with garlic
       and crackling pork rinds, also known as chicharr√≥n. To make mofongo, 
       the plantains are sliced and fried until tender, and then mashed with 
       garlic paste and pork cracklings. The mixture can either be formed into 
       balls or a half-dome shape. Mofongo is traditionally mashed in a mortar 
       and pestle, but you can use a potato masher if you don't have one.</p>

    <p>Mofongo is a side dish as well as the main course, especially when 
      it is stuffed with meat or seafood. It can be accompanied by a protein, 
      such as chicken or shrimp, and beans and rice, but is also often 
      presented in a bowl with a broth poured over the top. The Puerto Rican 
      dish is also served directly out of the mortar.</p>
