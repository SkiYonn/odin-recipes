      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>3 teaspoon grated ginger</li>
      <li>4 teaspoon grated garlic</li>
      <li>4 cup broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
      <li>4 cup water</li>

      <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
